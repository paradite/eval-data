Implement `cleanMarkdown` function that cleans markdown text, with the following rules:

- Unwrap code blocks
- Unwrap markdown links
- Remove tables
- Remove react components
- Remove import statements
- Remove frontmatter

The code would be placed inside `cleanMarkdown.ts`, and it would be tested by `test.ts`.
