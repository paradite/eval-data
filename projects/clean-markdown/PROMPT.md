Implement `cleanMarkdown` function that cleans markdown text, with the following rules:

- Unwrap code blocks
- Unwrap markdown links
- Replace headings with plain text
- Remove tables
- Remove react components
- Remove import statements
- Remove frontmatter

The code would be placed inside `cleanMarkdown.ts`, and it would be tested by `test.ts`.

Just output the content of `cleanMarkdown.ts` wrapped in markdown code block, no other text or explanation needed.
