DQN - DeepMind published their work on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in Nature, demonstrating how reinforcement learning with deep neural networks could achieve human-level performance across 49 Atari games, learning directly from pixel inputs.

AlphaGo - Google DeepMind created AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, combining Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep neural networks trained by supervised and reinforcement learning.
