DQN (Deep Q-Network) - Google DeepMind published the seminal paper introducing Deep Q-Networks, which successfully combined deep learning with reinforcement learning to achieve human-level performance on Atari games, marking a breakthrough in deep reinforcement learning.

ResNet - Microsoft Research introduced Residual Networks (ResNet), solving the vanishing gradient problem in very deep neural networks through skip connections, enabling training of networks with hundreds of layers and achieving breakthrough performance on ImageNet.
