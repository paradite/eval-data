2015

DQN (Deep Q-Network) - Google DeepMind published the seminal paper introducing Deep Q-Networks, which successfully combined deep learning with reinforcement learning to achieve human-level performance on Atari games, marking a breakthrough in deep reinforcement learning.

ResNet - Microsoft Research introduced Residual Networks (ResNet), solving the vanishing gradient problem in very deep neural networks through skip connections, enabling training of networks with hundreds of layers and achieving breakthrough performance on ImageNet.

2016

AlphaGo - Google DeepMind created AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player (Lee Sedol), combining Monte Carlo tree search with deep neural networks trained by supervised and reinforcement learning.

OpenAI Formation - OpenAI was founded as a non-profit AI research company by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others, with the stated mission to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.
