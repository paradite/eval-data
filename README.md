# Eval data

Evaluation data for LLMs and prompts on real world coding tasks in a variety of languages and frameworks. Initially the framework targets coding tasks in JavaScript, Python and SQL.

Built by [16x Prompt](https://prompt.16x.engineer/) and [16x Eval](https://eval.16x.engineer/). 

## Projects

### Next.js

[emoji-todo](/projects/emoji-todo/) - A simple Next.js TODO app with emojis.

### SQL

[sql](/projects/sql/) - SQL code snippets.

### Python

[python-script](/projects/python-script/) - Python script code snippets.

## Eval

I have decided to build a separate tool to evaluate models and prompts.

See [16x Eval website](https://eval.16x.engineer/) for more information.
